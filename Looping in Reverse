Looping through Arrays
const animals = ['Grizzly Bear', 'Sloth', 'Sea Lion'];
for (let i = 0; i < animals.length; i++){
  console.log(animals[i]);
};
//This example would give you the following output: Grizzly Bear, Sloth, Sea Lion


const vacationSpots = ['Bali', 'Paris', 'Tulum'];

for (let i = 0; i < vacationSpots.length; i++ ){
  console.log('I would love to visit ' + vacationSpots[i]);
}
